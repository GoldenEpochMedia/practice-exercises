Create a basic starter repository that includes common files, settings, and folder structure for your projects. This can act as a repo that you clone and reuse for new projects, and can be updated over time.

## Basic Requirements 
Your repository should include at least:

- A folder structure of your assets such as script files, styles, and images
- An `index.html` with common meta tags, links, and a base page structure.
- Any default styling or framework that can be reused from project to project. This may include resets, a sass framework, etc.
- A build tool worklfow: gulp/grunt/npm tasks, etc.
- A readme explaining the project, as well as how to get up and running
- A common gitignore file, and any other shared config files that may be useful in future projects. (linting, nvm, etc)

## Above and Beyond

Create branches or repositories specific to environments. For example, a react application may have a different starter repo and structure than a php applicaiton. As you run into areas that need updating, backport changes into the original repository.
